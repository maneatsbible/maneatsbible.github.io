Much confusion has arisen over the blurred distinction between the word of God and the Bible, which conveys the word of God. The confusion mainly began with Luther, and all of it perpetuates because people don't even understand the plain meaning of the word of God.

The Trinitarian belief that John 1 describes the incarnation of the Logos -- a fully Gnostic impulse -- and not simply the plain word of God being made manifest in the works of His Son Jesus, is weird to begin with, but it also contradicts the above believe that the word of God is the Bible.

When I preach the plain reading of the Bible, without even quoting Bible, I too serve as a conveyor of God's word -- and yet my words aren't holy scripture.

Get over yourself and follow Jesus, or you'll perish like all the other sinners.

That's the word of God, and yet they're also my words. Do you recognize the voice of His Spirit in those words, or not?

Because I wrote those words while in the Spirit of my Lord Jesus, the truth, which is also to be in the Holy Spirit -- Jesus and God are one in Spirit, and mine in Theirs -- I accomplished the supernatural work of preaching God-breathed words to this wicked generation.

Nowhere here have I given credibility to thoughts regarding scriptural infallibility ðŸ¤¡.

The scriptures are testimonies written by men of God moved by the Holy Spirit, and their testimonies are true. They convey the word of God. Read them plainly.

I've said my words here convey the word of God by the Holy Spirit in me, but it's fully up to you to test and discern the spirits. I proclaim the truth, which is the extent of my calling. I have no burden, nor even the ability, to make you receive the truth.
