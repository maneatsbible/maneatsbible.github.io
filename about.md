I'm a preacher of holiness and judgment in Christ Jesus, and I proclaim the truth without philosophical argumentation. Here it is:

God is love and His Son is life. Choose love. Choose life.

If you're still choosing to serve your flesh -- if you're still sinning -- then you're still with Satan. You need to stop all that and go with Jesus instead. No excuses.

I'm very much a Christian extremist, taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the extreme. No compromise. Everything else is a lie.

This website is a platform for my preaching.
