I'm a preacher of holiness and judgment in Christ Jesus, and I proclaim the truth without philosophical argumentation. Here it is:

God is love and His Son is life. Choose love. Choose life.

If you're still choosing to serve your flesh -- if you're still sinning -- then you're still with Satan. You need to stop all that and go with Jesus instead. No excuses.

I [read the Bible plainly]({{ site.url }}/book#introduction-to-plain-reading) without compromise. I'm a Christian extremist. I take the gospel of Jesus Christ to the extreme, because everything else is a lie.

On this website, I'm hosting:

* [Live preaching]({{ site.url }}/preaching)
