Christopher is a preacher of holiness and judgment in Christ Jesus, proclaiming the truth without philosophical argumentation. Here it is:

God is love and His Son is life. Choose love. Choose life.

If you're still choosing to serve your flesh -- if you're still sinning -- then you're still with Satan. You need to stop all that and go with Jesus instead. No excuses.

This is Christian extremism, which is true Christianity. Everything else is a lie.
