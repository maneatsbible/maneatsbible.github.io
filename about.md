I'm a preacher of holiness and judgment in Christ Jesus, and I proclaim the truth without philosophical argumentation. Here it is:

God is love and His Son is life. Choose love. Choose life.

If you're still choosing to serve your flesh -- if you're still sinning -- then you're still with Satan. You need to stop all that and go with Jesus instead. No excuses.

I [read the Bible plainly]({{ site.url }}/2023/08/07/plain-reading) without compromise. I'm a Jesus extremist. I take the gospel of Jesus Christ extremely seriously, because everything else is death.
