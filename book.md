# Preface

In a dream, I saw in my vision by night a dining table set before me, and a manservant entering the room with a white cloth draped over one arm.

"Good morning, Christopher," he said. "God has prepared a feast for you to eat in seven meals over three days. God made each meal in the beginning, but men freely choose not to partake, preferring their own meals instead, prepared by devils to suit their diverse tastes. So God cursed them by sealing His seven meals from them, until the day God's people could open them and eat by simply reading the Bible plainly."

The sections and chapters in this book comprise seven meals with seven seals, to be opened and eaten by the reader. Which vain philosophies have kept the meals in this plain reading sealed from you? Whatever they may be, you'll need to drop them now if you want to proceed.

Won't you please join me at the table, and eat the Bible with me? It's sometimes sweet, and sometimes bitter, but always good nourishment for your body and soul.

# Introduction to Plain Reading

Plain reading is to humble yourself in God's sight, putting aside all argumentation, vain imagination and philosophies of men, honestly seeking the coherence of the truth by sound exegesis, knowing context and intent by studying all of scripture.

# Section 1: Obey God

... or perish. Grace ain't your ticket to disobedience.

## Chapter 1: Fear God

The beginning of knowledge is to fear the LORD your God. Fools hate this wisdom.

## Chapter 2: Get Over Yourself

Humble yourself in the sight of God, and He will lift you up.

## Chapter 3: The Doctrine of Original Knowledge

This is about conscience, your God-given knowledge of right and wrong. It's also directly against the doctrine of disobedience called Original Sin.

# Section 2: This Proving Ground

We're all Job. God is testing all of us, to see who is worthy to dwell in His kingdom forever, and who is worthy for the fire that consumes, destroying even the soul in hell.

## Chapter 4: Heaven, Earth and Sea

Understanding the meaning of these three created realms is to understand the ancient worldview of the Hebrews, the frame around all scripture.

## Chapter 5: Men as Trees, Walking

God is the Gardener, and we're His trees. Seriously.

## Chapter 6: The Tower and the Tabernacle

This is about technology.

# Section 3: Prophecy

## Chapter 7: The Vast Conspiracy

Let me tell you about Solomon's Masons...

# Appendix A: The Good Questions of God and Jesus

An exhaustive list of all the questions asked by God and Jesus, directly and through their messengers, along with commentary. Their good questions teach us how to ask good questions.

# Appendix B: Plainly Reading the Proof-Texts

Here's where I'll attack false doctrines directly.
