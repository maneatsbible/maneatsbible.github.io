# Introduction to Plain Reading

*A*: Plain reading is to humble yourself in God's sight, putting aside all argumentation, vain imagination and the philosophies of men, honestly seeking the coherence of the truth by sound exegesis, knowing context and intent by studying all of scripture.

# Section 1: Obey God

*A*: Obey God or perish. Grace ain't your ticket to disobedience.

## Chapter 1: Fear God

The beginning of knowledge is to fear the LORD your God. Fools hate this wisdom.

## Chapter 2: Get Over Yourself

Humble yourself in the sight of God, and He will lift you up.

## Chapter 3: The Doctrine of Original Knowledge

This is about conscience -- your God-given knowledge of right and wrong. It's also directly against the doctrine of disobedience called Original Sin.

# Section 2: This Proving Ground

We're all Job. God is testing all of us, to see who is worthy to dwell in His kingdom forever, and who is worthy of the fire that consumes, destroying even their souls in hell.

## Chapter 4: Heaven, Earth and Sea

Understanding the meaning of these three created realms is to understand the ancient worldview of the Hebrews, the frame around all scripture.

## Chapter 5: Men as Trees, Walking

God is the Gardener, and we're trees. Seriously. I'll show you.

## Chapter 6: The Tower and the Tabernacle

This is about technology and the beast system. It's about men who build skyscrapers, and starships. They build idols, which are worthless. "They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made" (Isa 2:8b).

# Section 3: Prophecy

I will prophesy here, Lord willing, by preaching the word of God that comes by way of reading plainly.

## Chapter 7: The Vast Conspiracy

Let me tell you about Solomon and his Masons, and the temple they intend to build...

# Appendix A: The Good Questions of God and Jesus

An exhaustive list of all the questions asked by God and Jesus, directly and through their messengers, along with commentary. Their good questions teach us how to ask good questions in pursuit of the truth, which is needed for judging righteously as commanded by God. Asking good questions is a spiritual weapon that hypocrites cannot wield, as it will turn back and cut them too.

# Appendix B: Plainly Reading the Proof-Texts

Here's where I'll attack false doctrines directly.
