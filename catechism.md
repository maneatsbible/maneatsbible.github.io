# Introduction to Plain Reading

*A*: Plain reading is to humble yourself in God's sight, putting aside all argumentation, vain imagination and philosophies of men, honestly seeking the coherence of the truth by sound exegesis, knowing context and intent by studying all of scripture.

# Section 1: Obey God

... or perish. Grace ain't your ticket to disobedience.

## Chapter 1: Fear God

The beginning of knowledge is to fear the LORD your God. Fools hate this wisdom.

## Chapter 2: Get Over Yourself

Humble yourself in the sight of God, and He will lift you up.

## Chapter 7: The Vast Conspiracy

# Appendix A: The Good Questions of God and Jesus

An exhaustive list of all the questions asked by God and Jesus, directly and through their messengers, along with commentary. Their good questions teach us how to ask good questions in pursuit of the truth, which is needed for judging righteously as commanded by God. Asking good questions is a spiritual weapon that hypocrites cannot wield, as it will turn back and cut them too.

# Appendix B: Plainly Reading the Proof-Texts

Here's where I'll attack false doctrines directly.
